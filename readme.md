## Setup Guide (Raspberry Pi 3, Headless)

This guide is optimized to save power and run the Pi headless (without monitor/keyboard/mouse).

### 1. **Install OS and Enable SSH**

- **Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite** (no desktop) on the SD card (using the Raspberry Pi Imager: https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
   - Select "Raspberry Pi OS Lite"
   - When prompted, edit settings:
      - Set hostname (default is `raspberrypi.local`).
      - Create a user called `pi` and set password (there is no longer a default user).
      - Enable SSH by checking the box under Services (or create an empty file named `ssh` in the boot partition after writing the image).
   - Select the SD card and write the image.

### 2. **Configure for Low Power**

Edit `config.txt` in the `boot` partition of the SD card and edit (or add if not present) the following lines to disable HDMI, onboard LEDs, and other unused hardware:
   You will need to remove the SD card and plug it back in.

```
# Disable HDMI to save power
hdmi_blanking=2

# Disable ACT LED
dtparam=act_led_trigger=none
dtparam=act_led_activelow=on

# Disable onboard audio (if not needed)
dtparam=audio=off

# Disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth if not needed
dtoverlay=disable-wifi
dtoverlay=disable-bt
```

> **Note:** Only disable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth if you are using Ethernet or do not need wireless access.

---

### 3. **Boot the Pi**
- Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it on.
- Wait for a minute or two for the Pi to boot up and enable SSH.

---

### 4. **Connect to the Pi**

- Use an Ethernet cable or connect to the Pi's Wi-Fi network (only if needed; don't disable Wi-Fi in `config.txt` if you need it).
- Use the domain name you set up (`raspberrypi.local`) or find the Pi's IP address using your router's admin page.
- **SSH into the Pi:**  
  ```sh
  ssh pi@<your_pi_ip>
  ```
> **Note:** You may need to accept the SSH key fingerprint on first connection.
- **Login** with the credentials you set up earlier  

---

### 5. **Disable Unused Services**

```sh
sudo systemctl disable --now hciuart.service
sudo systemctl disable --now bluetooth.service
sudo systemctl disable --now avahi-daemon.service
sudo systemctl disable --now triggerhappy.service
```

---

### 6. **Clone the Repository**

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
git clone <repository_url> /home/pi/timelapse_recorder
```
Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of this repository,
probably `https://github.com/theMoonlitWolf/timelapse_recorder`.
> **Note:** If you are using a different location for the repository, adjust the path in `timelapse_recorder_.service` accordingly.
> **Note:** You may need to accept instalation of additional packages when installing git.

---

### 7. **Install Dependencies**

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip ffmpeg libcamera-apps
pip3 install RPi.GPIO
```
> **Note:** You may need to accept installation of additional packages.

---

### 8. **Wire Up the LEDs and Buttons**

See the GPIO table below for pin assignments.

---

### 9. **Set Up the Systemd Service**

- Copy `timelapse_recorder.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/`:
  ```sh
  sudo cp /home/pi/timelapse_recorder/timelapse_recorder.service /etc/systemd/system/
  ```
- Enable the service to start on boot:
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl enable timelapse_recorder.service
  ```
- Start the service manually (or reboot):
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl start timelapse_recorder.service
  ```

---

## Accessing the Pi for Setup and Troubleshooting

- **SSH:** Use `ssh pi@<your_pi_ip>` from another computer on your network.
- **File Transfer:** Use `scp` or an SFTP client (like WinSCP or FileZilla) to upload/download files.
- **Logs:** View live logs remotely with:
```sh
journalctl -u timelapse_recorder -f
```
- **USB Drive:** All timelapse images, videos and log files are saved to the USB drive, which can be removed and read on any computer.

---

## Usage

- **Insert a USB drive** before or just after powering on.
- **LEDs** will indicate status (see below).
- **Press the Speed button** to cycle through speed presets (LED blinks to indicate selection).
- **Press the Start/Stop button** to begin or end recording.
- After recording, the video is rendered and saved to the USB drive.
- The Pi will power down automatically when finished.

## Viewing Logs

The log file will be saved at `/tmp/timelapse.log` and copied to the USB drive after the script finishes.

To view live logs from the service:
```sh
journalctl -u timelapse_recorder -f
```
This shows all output and errors from the script in real time.

## Rendering the Timelapse Video Later

### Skip Rendering on the Pi

- The Pi waits a few seconds before rendering.
- **To skip rendering and save images for later:**  
  During the waiting period (yellow LED), **press the SPEED button**.
- The Pi will move the images to the `render` folder and power down.
- Remove the USB drive and connect it to your computer.

### Render Later on the Pi

1. **Insert the USB drive** with the `render` folder back into the Pi.
2. **Power on the Pi** (or reboot).
3. The script will detect the `render` folder and automatically start the rendering process after a short wait.
4. **Do not press the SPEED button** during the wait if you want rendering to proceed.
5. When rendering is complete, the video will be saved to your USB drive and the Pi will power down.
   > **Note:** The `render` folder will be deleted. 

- This feature can be used in case of render failure (rename `timelapse_images` to `render` on the USB drive), or if the battery is nearly empty after recording.

### Render on Your Computer

#### Install FFmpeg on Windows

1. Download FFmpeg from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (choose a Windows build, e.g., from [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)).
2. Extract the zip (e.g., to `C:\ffmpeg`).
3. (Optional) Add `C:\ffmpeg\bin` to your system PATH for easy access.

#### Render the Video from Images

1. Open **Command Prompt** (`cmd`).
2. Navigate to the folder with your images (e.g., `render`):
   ```sh
   cd E:\render
   ```
3. Run FFmpeg:
   ```sh
   ffmpeg -framerate 24 -i img%05d.jpg -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p timelapse.mp4
   ```
   - You can add `-vf "scale=1280:960,setsar=1:1"` to specify scale and aspect ratio. Images are shot at 1440x1080 (4:3).

## Updating the Timelapse Recorder

To update your timelapse recorder code to the latest version, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd /home/pi/timelapse_recorder
```

2. Check if you have local changes:
```sh
git status
```
   If you have changes, resolve merge conflicts.

3. Pull the latest changes from the repository:
```sh
git pull
```
   This will download and apply any updates from the remote repository.

4. (Optional) Update Python dependencies if needed:
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --only-upgrade python3 python3-pip ffmpeg libcamera-apps
pip3 install --upgrade RPi.GPIO
```

5. (Optional) Update the service file if needed (mentioned in changelog)
```sh
sudo cp /home/pi/timelapse_recorder/timelapse_recorder.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

6. Restart the systemd service to apply the update:
```sh
sudo systemctl restart timelapse_recorder.service
```

- All necessary commands in one:
```sh
cd /home/pi/timelapse_recorder
git pull
sudo systemctl restart timelapse_recorder.service
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Service won’t start:** Check wiring, dependencies, and run `sudo systemctl status timelapse_recorder`.
- **No video output:** Ensure images are captured and USB has enough space.
- **LED stuck on error:** Check logs with `journalctl -u timelapse_recorder -f`.
- **Network/SSH issues:** Re-enable Wi-Fi/Ethernet as needed for remote access.
